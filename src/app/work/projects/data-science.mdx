This collection of data science projects demonstrates my expertise in leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from creating personalized movie recommendation systems to developing robust models for credit card fraud detection and optimizing financial portfolio generation.

## Technologies Used

Python, R, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Projects

- **Movie Recommendation System**: Developed a Multilayer Perceptron model to provide movie recommendations.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Implemented machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions in real time, reducing financial losses by 25% for users.
- **Financial Portfolio Generation**: Designed an optimization algorithm that generates diversified investment portfolios based on historical data and risk tolerance, helping users make informed financial decisions.

## Challenges Faced
Each project presented unique challenges, such as dealing with imbalanced datasets in fraud detection and ensuring the accuracy of recommendations in real-time systems. I applied various techniques, including oversampling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, to overcome these hurdles.

## Outcome
These projects not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into user behavior and financial decision-making, demonstrating the impact of data-driven solutions in various industries.
