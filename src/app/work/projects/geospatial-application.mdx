Developed a drone-based system to monitor critical areas in Singapore, focusing on detecting obstructions in fire access routes and other essential zones. By integrating geospatial mapping, drone imagery, and computer vision, this solution automates safety inspections and enhances operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker
- **AI/ML**: Qwen, LLaVA, MiniCPM

## Key Features

- **Map Interface**: Created an interactive interface allowing users to draw and edit polygons on a geospatial map.
- **Computer Vision Analysis**: Implemented a pipeline for analyzing user-uploaded GeoTiff files to detect obstructions using a large vision model.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Developed a dashboard for real-time monitoring of key sites using historical data.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Collaborated with users to automate report generation based on collected data.

## Challenges Faced

Overcame challenges in geospatial data integration and real-time processing by optimizing data handling and model performance.

## Outcome
This project enhanced my skills in geospatial data integration, drone technology, and computer vision, showcasing my ability to develop scalable, tech-driven solutions with significant safety applications.
